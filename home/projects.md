# *Personal Projects*

Over the years, I've worked on a variety of personal projects.
And to me, they're the bread and butter of my portfolio. I am
most proud of what I've accomplished with these, and they've served
as invaluable learning tools, which have allowed me to 
experiment and experience new technologies and ideas.
