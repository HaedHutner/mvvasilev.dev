# Biography

## Who am I?

Hi, my name is Miroslav, and I'm what you might consider a software developer.

## What do I do?

I develop software solutions to problems. I've been doing this professionally for a 
little under a year so far, and unprofessionally for 7-8 years.

## Why do I do it?

I like programming. It's like puzzle solving, except all you're given is a vague idea
of what the end result is meant to look like, and it's up to you to come up with the
pieces and put them together.
